# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Project Objective: 
Creating an Tableau Dashboard highlighting genre sales, album sales, customer sales, total revenue generated, and a map highlighting sales performance globally. 
To accomplish this dashboard, I will be using sqlite3 in python to connect to a SQL database in DBeaver to generate a query of information that is relavent to the metrics I want to hightlight.
